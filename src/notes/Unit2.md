# Unit 2

## 2.1 Classes and Objects

### Using objects

`System.out.println("Hello World")`

Call a method called `println` defined in `System` class. To invoke the method, we need to call the object of `System`
class, `out`. Then, we input the parameter of `println` defined in `System` class.

### Abstraction

We don't have to think about internal details in order to use an object. Help to write complex programs

## 2.2 Strings

### Character Strings

Defined by `String` class. Every literal string delimited by double quotation marks represents a `String` object.

The string concatenation operator (+) is used to append one string to the end of another It can also be used to append a
number to a string

A string literal cannot be broken across two lines in a program.

### Escape Sequences

An escape sequence is a series of characters that represents a special character.

An escape sequence begins with a backslash character (\), which indicates that the character(s) that follow should be
treated in a special way.

`System.out.println ("I said \"Hello\" to you.");`

* \b backspace
* \t tab
* \n newline
* \r carriage return
* \" double quote
* \' single quote
* \\ backslash
